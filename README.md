InstaVid is a web-application that allows users to upload short videos 
and comment on them. Users are able to see an overview of all the videos
on the homepage but can also be redirected to a single video if they wish. 
Comments can only be seen and written on that single-video page.
In order to be able to upload and comment videos, any user must sign up
and be logged in.
