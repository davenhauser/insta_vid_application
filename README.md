InstaVid is a web-application that functions together with the popular application [Vine](https://vine.co/). 
In order to have full access to all the functionalities on InstaVid, any user needs to create an account and be signed in. This will allow them to upload vines (short videos of max. 6 seconds), see what other users have uploaded and comment on any Vine they like. Users can chose between looking at an overview of all uploaded Vines or display a single Vine at a time.

##Technologies Used

In order to build and deploy this web-application I used the following technologies and services:

- Ruby
- Rails
- Paperclip
- ImageMagick
- .env
- Amazon S3
- Heroku
- HTML5
- CSS
- SASS
- Bootstrap

##Design

I wanted this web-application to have a simple but clean look, similar to the designs of [Vine](https://vine.co/) or [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/). In order to ensure a pleasant user experience, on the main page there are 3 columns with all the uploaded vines, including the title and other suplementary infromation. Furthermore any signed in user can access an overview of all the vines they have posted (in this case they are displayed in 4 colums), as well as display a single vine.    
Only two fonts were used for this web-application; _cool_ for the logo and _fabada_ for the rest of the text. Most of the formatting is done with help of bootstrap.   
The home page shows a vine-compilation in fullscreen and autoplay mode.
